# Stata to Open Source
A start-up guide to using open source software to do the tasks that researchers may be used to doing in Stata. I start with introductions to the pandas library for python and R (with a focus on the tidyverse). 
This guide is oriented towards the type of empirical work that Economists do, and works through some examples of tasks that may be typically done in Stata. 

The guide does NOT attempt to be a step-by-step introduction to installing and using these programs; it assumes basic working knowledge of these languages, and simply translates "How would I do this in Stata..." to R and python through working examples.
