# Stata to Open Source
A start-up guide to using open source software to do the tasks that researchers may be used to doing in Stata. I start with introductions to the pandas library for python and R (with a focus on the tidyverse). 
This guide is oriented towards the type of empirical work that Economists do, and works through some examples of tasks that may be typically done in Stata. 

For a step by step guide to getting started with python, see **python_up&running.html** in the installation guides folder.

In general, the intro guides do NOT attempt to be a step-by-step introduction to installing and using these programs; they assume basic working knowledge of these languages, and simply translate "How would I do this in Stata..." to R and python through working examples.

To get started with a Stata user's intro to pandas, open **intro_stata_to_pandas.ipynb**. 
To get started with a Stata user's intro to R/tidyverse, open **intro_stata_to_r.html**. The associated files, should you want a look under the hood, can be found in the folder intro_stata_to_r_files.
