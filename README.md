## ARE computing and programming resources

This repository is a hub of assorted resources compiled to help ARE students learn to program for Economics in open source software, principally R and python. The organization of this repository is as follows;

1. **Stata to opensource** is a pair of tutorials that go through common data cleaning and manipulation exercises that one might do in Stata in both R and python. For now this tutorial is limited to data analysis; in the future, topics on regression analysis and exporting to LaTeX will be added.

2. **Installation guide** is a getting up and running in python guide, that works through installing python, writing a first python script in the console and in a text editor, and IDE's. 

3. The **topics** folder is a catch-all for topical tutorials focused on students in ARE 212. For now, it includes only:
* A short introduction to list comprehensions in python
* A guide to branching, pull requests, and code review in github. 

A huge thanks to Simon Greenhill for his contributions to this repository and Berkeley ARE for supporting this work.
